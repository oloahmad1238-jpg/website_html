    <h1>About Space</h1>
    <h2>What is space and what’s floating about in it?</h2>
    <h3>Scientists have discovered a lot about space,</h3>
    <h3>how it works and the things in it, but there are still loads of mysteries left to solve.</h3>
    <h3>Space is the vast expanse of the universe where energy and matter </h3>
    <h3>stuff that takes up room and has mass – exist. So,</h3>
    <h3>it’s not a totally empty void, but did you know that less than 5% of the whole universe is normal,</h3>
    <h3>visible matter? That includes all the solids, liquids, gases and other tiny particles</h3>
    <h3>that make up the things we can see and interact with, such as stars and planets.</h3>
    <h3>While we can’t see or detect them yet, we think that</h3>
    <h3>dark matter and dark energy are a huge part of the universe and how it works.</h3>
    <h3>Space is full of radiation. Some of it is left over from the beginning of the universe</h3>
    <h3>Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation tells us that our universe</h3>
    <h3>is 13.8 billion years old and started with the Big Bang.</h3>
    <h3>Since the Big Bang, space has been expanding, going from a single point</h3>
    <h3>to the size it is now. In fact, it’s still expanding and at an accelerating rate.</h3>
    <h3>We don’t know why expansion is getting faster, but scientists think it has something to do with dark energy.</h3>

    <h2>Where does space begin?</h2>
    <h3>For official records, we often say that outer space begins at 100 kilometres above Earth’s sea level. We call this the Kármán Line.</h3>
    <h3>But there actually isn’t an exact point where the sky ends and space begins.</h3>
    <h3>Instead, the higher you go, the thinner Earth’s atmosphere gets until it becomes space.</h3>
    <h3>The outermost layer is called the exosphere and ends at least 10,000 kilometres from Earth.</h3>
    <h3>Material spewing from the Sun provides a protective bubble around our solar system called the heliosphere. This material’s effects end at a boundary called the heliopause. Beyond this is interstellar space – the space between stars.</h3>
    <hr>
    <h2>Light years</h2>
    <h3>Space is huge! In fact, we don’t really know just how big it is.</h3>
    <h3>We measure the extremely long distances between things in space by light years.</h3>
    <h3>A light year is the distance that light travels in one Earth year.</h3>
    <h3>Light travels at about 300,000 kilometres per second. So, one light year is about nine trillion kilometres.</h3>
    <hr>
    <h2>Nebulae</h2>
    <h3>A nebula is a cloud of dust and gas in space.</h3>
    <h3>Nebulae – meaning more than one nebula – are often where new stars form as the dust and gas gets pulled together by gravity.</h3>
    <h3>Dying stars can also create nebulae when they throw out their contents in the final stages of their life.</h3>
    <h3>Some nebulae emit their own light while others reflect the light of nearby stars.</h3>
    <h3>Dark nebulae obscure light, creating dark patches in the sky.</h3>

    <h2>Stars</h2>
    <h3>Stars are giant balls of superheated gas. Atoms are squeezed together at their centre creating elements and energy that’s released as light and heat.</h3>
    <h3>Baby stars – called protostars – form when a nebula clumps together, collapses under its own gravity and starts to generate heat.</h3>
    <h3>When protostars get hot and dense enough to cause nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium, we call them main-sequence stars.</h3>
    <h3>This phase can last billions of years.</h3>
    <h3>Eventually stars run out of hydrogen for fuel and their core collapses under gravity.</h3>
    <h3>Small stars, such as our Sun, expand from a dwarf into a red giant.</h3>
    <h3>In about five billion years the Sun will engulf the planets closest to it, possibly including Earth.</h3>
    <h3>Five billion years later, it’ll shrink, becoming a white dwarf that’ll cool down over billions of years.</h3>

    <h2>Black holes</h2>
    <h3>Black holes have extremely strong gravitational fields. Anything – matter, energy and even light – that gets too close can’t escape. This point is called the event horizon.</h3>
    <h3>At the centre of a black hole is the singularity. This is where our laws of physics break down.</h3>
    <h3>We can’t see black holes directly, but we can detect the gravitational waves they create or observe the light-emitting accretion disks around them.</h3>
    <h3>Stellar mass black holes have masses a few times greater than our Sun. Supermassive black holes are found at the centres of galaxies and have masses millions of times greater than the Sun.</h3>

    <h2>Planetary systems and galaxies</h2>
    <h3>Stars have strong gravity. They attract objects such as planets, asteroids, and comets, which orbit around them.</h3>
    <h3>Our solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago from a dusty disk called the solar nebula. It's just one of many planetary systems in our galaxy.</h3>
    <h3>Galaxies are made of stars, dust, and gas, held together by gravity. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy and has a supermassive black hole at its center called Sagittarius A*.</h3>

    <h2>Planets</h2>
    <h3>Planets must orbit a star, be nearly spherical, and have cleared their orbit of other debris.</h3>
    <h3>There are eight planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars (terrestrial), Jupiter, Saturn (gas giants), Uranus, and Neptune (ice giants).</h3>

    <h2>Moons</h2>
    <h3>Moons orbit planets and can vary in shape and activity. Earth’s Moon is calm, but Jupiter’s Io has over 400 active volcanoes.</h3>
    <h3>Some planets have no moons, like Mercury and Venus. Saturn has over 270 moons – and counting!</h3>
